# üîê paste.id ‚Äî api

`paste.id` is an encrypted paste storage server built using JS

This is the server/api repository. If you are looking for the client repository click [here](https://github.com/posixpascal/pasteid-web)

## Installation

paste.id is a very very very basic server built using NodeJS. 
To install paste.id clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install .
```

Once npm runs through successfully add a .env file within the root directory which contains your mySQL credentials as well as the port we're running on:

```
MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASS=root
MYSQL_DB=pasteid

PORT=3002
```

## Running
Running paste.id server is as easy as executing a few npm scripts. 
If you are curious what scripts can be launched take a look at `package.json`.

### DB migration:
Once your `.env` file is ready and your npm dependencies are installed,
just execute `node migrate.js` to create the necessary database tables.

### In Development
To run paste.id server in development mode run:
```
npm run start-dev
```

This command will automatically start nodemon which will continously watch for file changes and reload paste.id server accordingly.

### In Production

Running on production requires an intermediate step where you build and compile your application. 

```bash
npm run build # only on code change
npm run production
```

I'm using `forever` which will start your app and restart it automatically if it should crash.

## Dependencies

paste.id server has only a handful of production dependencies these being:

- mysql (node module)
- dotenv
- express

## How it works
Since the main logic is happening on paste.id frontend I can explain this server with just a few words:

Basically this server has 2 endpoints:

- `POST /storage` which will accept a `content` property and store it in a mySQL DB
- `GET /:id` will output a JSON payload which contains a `content` property which itself contains the message you stored before.

So all in all, paste.id server is just a stupid simple text storage over HTTP.
The encryption layer is provided by the paste.id frontend application.

## Contribution
Contribution is generally appreciated. Here are a few things you can do to extend paste.id server:

- Add unit tests
- Replace mySQL in pasteRepository.js with an ORM so we can hook up other DBs
- Extract the DB storage mechanism in a different class so we later add storage to textfiles as well by injecting the required `StorageMechanism`
- Add better error handling
- Add support to "verify" a pgp encrypted paste without outputting the content by accepting a public key via variable.
- Add scripts to auto-remove logfiles etc.
- Add expiration to pastes.
- Add option to generate a more "random" ID rather than using the SQL autoincrement ID.
